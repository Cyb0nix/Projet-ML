### Predict the weather with a photo of the sky.

## Description
This project is a web application that allows users to upload a photo of the sky and get a weather prediction. The application uses a machine learning model to predict the weather based on the cloud cover in the photo. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled cloud images, each cloud type being associated with a weather condition.

## Demo
